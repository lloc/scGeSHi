Simple code highlighting plugin for your remote source files

== Description ==

Simple code highlighting plugin for your remote source files

It is powered by the [GeSHi engine](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/) which supports a large number of programming languages

The plugin is using styles like [Code Snippet](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codesnippet-20/). Thanks to Roman Roan and Wyatt Neal. In addition, I would like to thank [JÃ¼rgen Mayer](http://designetage.com/) for making the banner of this plugin.

== Installation ==

- download the plugin
- uncompress it with your preferred unzip programme
- copy the entire directory myLCO in your plugins directory of your wordpress blog (/wp-content/plugins)
- activate the plugin in your plugins admin page
- now you can use shortcodes like [source href="http://source_code_url" lang="php"]
